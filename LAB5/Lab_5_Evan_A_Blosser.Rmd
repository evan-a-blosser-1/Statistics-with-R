## Task 2 summary
  Comparing results from the 10,000 iteration run of mybin() to that of "dbinom"
  it can be seen that the values are indeed approximately correct. Assuming we note that 
  $5.9049\times e^{6}$ is approximately zero.




# Task 3

## sample()

There are 20 marbles, population, with $12$ being white and denoted as "1" in the simulation
  , probability is $\frac{3}{5}$, and $8$ being black denoted as "0" with probability $\frac{2}{5}$.

Thus, we have a sample size of 5 **WITHOUT** replacement:
```{r}
Marble.bag  <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
Marble.prob <- c(3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5)
sample(Marble.bag,size=5,prob=Marble.prob, replace=FALSE)
```
**with**
```{r}
Marble.bag  <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
Marble.prob <- c(3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,3/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5,2/5)
sample(Marble.bag,size=5,prob=Marble.prob, replace=TRUE)
```

## myhyper()
```{r}
myhyper=function(iter=100,N=20,r=12,n=5){
# make a matrix to hold the samples
#initially filled with NA's
sam.mat=matrix(NA,nr=n,nc=iter, byrow=TRUE)
#Make a vector to hold the number of successes over the trials
succ=c()
for( i in 1:iter){
#Fill each column with a new sample
sam.mat[,i]=sample(rep(c(1,0),c(r,N-r)),n,replace=FALSE)
#Calculate a statistic from the sample (this case it is the sum)
succ[i]=sum(sam.mat[,i])
}
#Make a table of successes
succ.tab=table(factor(succ,levels=0:n))
#Make a barplot of the proportions
barplot(succ.tab/(iter), col=rainbow(n+1), main="HYPERGEOMETRIC simulation", xlab="Number of successes")
succ.tab/iter
}
# cmd: myhyper(iter=1000,n=19, N=20,r=12)

# cmd: dhyper(x=0:19, m=12, n=8, k=19)

## Iterations = 100

```{r}

```

## Iterations = 200
```{r}
myhyper(iter=200,n=5,N=20,r=12)
```

## Iterations = 500
```{r}
myhyper(iter=500,n=5,N=20,r=12)
```

## Iterations = 1,000
```{r}
myhyper(iter=1000,n=5,N=20,r=12)
```

## Iterations = 10,000
```{r}
myhyper(iter=10000,n=5,N=20,r=12)
```



## Verifying the 10,000 iteration table:
```{r}
dhyper(x=0:19, m=12, n=8, k=19)
```
these are approximatly correct given that the setting n = 10 gives an identical distribution to **dhyper**
```{r}
myhyper(iter=10000,n=10,N=20,r=12)
```


# Task 4
![Running **mysample()** out of R markdown](SharedScreenshot.jpg)



## What this function does:
 This function **mysample()** takes a sample of numbers 1 through 10, with replacement, and creates a new set of probability graphs for each of the 30 iterations.It also slows down the knitting process significantly which is why a screenshot was included of it running in a .R script. 

 All the graphs are slightly different yet their probabilities for numbers 1 through 10 all center around $0.10$
  or it can be seen that all numbers have an almost equal chance of being selected by **mysample()**. 


# Task 5
